// def: JavaScript is a cross-platform(multiple platform(chrome,firefox,edge,etc...)), object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment ( a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.


//1. Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the following format.  
// Sample Output : Today is : Tuesday.
// Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38

// const toDay = new Date();
// const day = toDay.getDay();
// const dayList = ["sunday","monday","tuesuaday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday"];
// const exactday = console.log("Today is : "+dayList[day-1]); 

// const timeHour = toDay.getHours();
// const PmAm = (timeHour >= 12) ? " PM" : " AM"
// const timeMinute = toDay.getMinutes();
// const timeSecond = toDay.getSeconds();

// console.log(timeHour+ PmAm+" : "+timeMinute+" : "+timeSecond);

//2. Write a JavaScript program to print the current window contents.
//   function Printpage(){
//     window.print();
//   }
